Where do I begin?

Recently, I started Anyverse with [Andrew](https://andrewmitson.com) and [Taran](https://taran.io).

Anyverse matters because it's what I wish I'd had five years ago.

Anyverse is a platform for students to truly find the _right_ university - not the one that promises the most, but the one that will help them along _their_ path.

**I love learning things – I hate when I'm forced to.**

The reality is that students are pressured to go to university – even when it's not right for them.

I knew that university wasn't right for _me_ – so I **sabotaged** my own chances of getting into university.

I failed my A Levels, **purposefully**.

To find my own path.

Not in university.

But in something else.

Something that I'm passionate about.

Something that I don't know where it'll take me.

Something that _actually_ matters to me – and to the world.

And while this writing is not _actually_ everything, it's the start of something.

**Something that I'm finally doing for myself.**

Something that I'm finally doing for _you_.
