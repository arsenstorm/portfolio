As humans, we judge _everything_—as we should.

We should judge people based on our beliefs, ideas, and experiences. And we absolutely should exercise prejudice against others for our safety and security.

Our ability to judge is part of our basic survival needs, and judgements should not be made lightly—they must be kind yet fair, not to others but to ourselves.
