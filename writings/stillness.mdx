We often interpret stillness as emptiness, inaction, or lack thereof.

Yet it is in stillness in which we find clarity, presence, and fulfilment.

To be still is to embrace stillness entirely—not to retreat from the world, but to be present in it.

Stillness is the pause between breaths, the silence before thought, and the space where creation begins.

It is not passive but potent, offering an opportunity to truly see, feel, and understand.
