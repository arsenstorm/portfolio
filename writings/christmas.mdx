> An annual reminder of what we’ve forgotten—the beauty of giving without [Expectations.](/writing/expectations)

At its core, Christmas celebrates giving and connection—the gift of Christ from God and the connection brought to us through the Holy Spirit. 

Modern traditions, however, have obscured the purity of these acts, diminishing the focus on meaningful giving and genuine connection.

[Expectations.](/writing/expectations) is linked here as it reminds us to let go of our expectations of others. Doing so allows us to give—and receive—with authenticity.
